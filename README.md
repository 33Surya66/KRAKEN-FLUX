 # KRAKEN-FLUX

Kinetic Response Agent for Critical Events Network - Forensic Logic Unity eXecutor

## Overview

KRAKEN-FLUX is an autonomous cybersecurity platform that deploys coordinated AI agent swarms to detect, analyze, contain, and remediate security incidents in real-time. The system operates as a truly autonomous defense capability while maintaining forensic integrity and regulatory compliance.

## Key Features

- Real-time threat detection and response
- Autonomous incident handling
- Forensic evidence preservation
- Regulatory compliance automation
- Advanced AI-driven decision making
- Quantum-ready security architecture

## System Architecture

The platform consists of several specialized AI agents:

1. **Guardian Agents**: Primary threat detection and assessment
2. **Forensic Preservation Agents**: Evidence collection and chain of custody
3. **Containment Orchestration Agents**: Threat isolation and response
4. **Compliance and Documentation Agents**: Regulatory and legal framework
5. **Simulation and Modeling Agents**: Threat analysis and response planning

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
